# What is feature scaling?

- Feature scaling/ Data Normalization is a method used to normalize the range of independent 
variables or features of data. 
- Example: 
    - Feature A originally ranges from 50000 to 300,000. 
    - After Scaling: Feature A ranges from 0 to 1
- In a ML Project Pipeline, Feature Scaling is generally performed during
 the data preprocessing step. 

# Why Feature Scaling?

- The range of all features should be normalized so that each feature 
contributes approximately proportionately to the Cost Function
- Gradient descent converges much faster with feature scaling than without it
- Apply feature scaling if regularization is used as part of the
 loss function (so that coefficients are penalized appropriately)
