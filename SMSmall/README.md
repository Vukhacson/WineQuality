## Tutorials to set up collaboration workflow

### 1. Clone the repo on Github
```
git clone https://github.com/ScaleMind-C9308A/WineQuality.git
```
### 2. Create your new branch and merge 
- Inside the cloned directory, right click -> choose `Git Bash`. 
- Then run the following code to create your new branch :
```
cd SMSmall/
# Create your new branch
git checkout -b <yourname>_DataExplore_<Task>
# Merge your newly created branch with origin/SMSmall branch on remote
git merge origin/SMSmall
```
- An editing terminal (Vim) will open and show you the generated merging messages. To save the message and continue with the merge,
press `Esc` key -> type `:wq` -> press Enter
### 3. Create virtual environment
- Continue to run the following line to create new virtual environment
```
virtualenv .env
source .env/bin/activate
```
### 4. Install the required python pkgs using one of the 2 options:
```
# Option 1: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Option 2:
pip install -U jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib scipy seaborn 
```
### 5. Open jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
- Then choose the `SMSmall_Wine_quality_data_exploration.ipynb`
- Edit directly into the jupyter notebook according to assignments
  - **!Remember to comment your name before your code**
- (Optional) You can choose to read my notebook (only as reference!) `Data Exploration - Wine Dataset.ipynb`

###  6. After finishing assignment: Push changes to Github
- Open another terminal inside the repo, then run the following:
```
git pull origin SMSmall # pull before push
# Commit your changes and push your branch to Github
git add .
git commit -m "<Your message>"
git push -u origin <yourname>_DataExploration
```
